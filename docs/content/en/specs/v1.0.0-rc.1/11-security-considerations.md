# 11. Security Considerations

## 11.1 Format Security

### 11.1.1 Header Security

- The magic bytes and version fields must be validated before processing
- Header checksums must be verified before processing container contents
- Header size fields must be validated to prevent buffer overflows
- Unknown header flags must be handled according to specification

### 11.1.2 Metadata Security

- Metadata encryption is recommended for sensitive information
- Metadata checksums must be verified before use
- Metadata size fields must be validated
- Unknown metadata fields must be handled according to specification

## 11.2 Algorithm Security

### 11.2.1 Algorithm Selection

- NULL algorithms (ID = 0) must be handled appropriately
- Unknown algorithm IDs must result in parsing errors
- Algorithm combinations must be validated for compatibility
- Custom algorithms (ID >= 0x80000000) must be clearly documented

### 11.2.2 Algorithm Parameters

- Algorithm parameters must be validated before use
- Parameter size fields must be checked for validity
- Unknown parameters must be handled according to specification
- Parameter combinations must be validated for security

## 11.3 Container Security

### 11.3.1 Chunk Security

- Chunk boundaries must be validated
- Chunk size fields must be checked for validity
- Chunk checksums must be verified
- Chunk encryption must be properly initialized

### 11.3.2 Stream Security

- Stream boundaries must be validated
- Stream size fields must be checked for validity
- Stream checksums must be verified
- Stream encryption must be properly initialized

## 11.4 Implementation Requirements

### 11.4.1 Error Handling

- Invalid containers must be rejected
- Unsupported algorithms must be clearly reported
- Security-critical errors must be logged
- Error messages must not leak sensitive information

### 11.4.2 Validation Requirements

- All size fields must be validated
- All checksums must be verified
- All algorithm parameters must be validated
- All metadata fields must be validated
