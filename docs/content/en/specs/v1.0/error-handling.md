# Error Handling

In the event of an error, the Cryptdatum format specifies the following handling guidelines:

- **Header Validation Failure**: 
    - If validation of header fields fails, a "Header Invalid" error should be returned.
    - Provide additional context on which validation failed and potentially a hint on how to resolve the error.

- **Magic Number or Delimiter Validation Failure**: 
    - If validation of the `MAGIC` or `DELIMITER` fields fails, an "Unsupported Format" error should be returned.

- **Version Field Validation**: 
    - The `VERSION` field must be less than or equal to the latest specification version.
    - Implementations may limit the range of versions supported.
    - A clear and concise error should be returned to indicate that the Cryptdatum version is out of the supported range.
